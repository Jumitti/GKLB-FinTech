Welcome to **GK!LB**, your complete financial management tool. 
**GK!LB** is a comprehensive financial tool designed to monitor the performance of savings accounts across
various depositories. With a user-friendly interface, users can seamlessly optimize their investments
by efficiently managing multiple savings accounts within a single application. The left sidebar
facilitates easy addition of depositories and provides convenient controls for configuring savings
accountsâ€”enabling users to add, modify, or delete accounts with ease. GK!LB simplifies the process of
tracking and optimizing savings, offering a streamlined and efficient financial management solution.

## Why use **GK!LB** ?

It is essential to recognize that maintaining an inactive 
balance in an account is not a productive strategy. In addition, fluctuations in account interest rates from year to 
year may occur without notice.

We frequently observe that many individuals neglect paying attention to their savings accounts, which can result in loss
of capital optimization. A dormant account reaching its limit will not generate additional income from one year to the next, 
as interest will be calculated on the existing limit. It is therefore imperative to move your funds wisely for maximum 
optimization.

Optimizing your funds requires an annual review, but explore the software to understand that the first few years are 
crucial for optimization. With GK!LB, you will be able to graphically visualize the evolution of your balances and 
interests without optimization. Optimization, unsurprisingly, will bring significant improvement.

Use the blue column to visually analyze the distribution of your funds between your different accounts. Take advantage 
of this representation to make informed decisions and maximize your winnings. Every year counts in the race to financial 
optimization, and GK!LB is here to support you every step of the way.
